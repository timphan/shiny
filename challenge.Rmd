#555 challenge

Future Ted: Kids, everyone has an opinion on how long it takes to recover from a breakup.  
Lily: Half the length of the relationship.  
Marshall: One week for every month you were together.  
Robin: Exactly 10,000 drinks. However long that takes.  
Barney: You can't measure something like this in time. There's a series of steps. From her bed to the front door.   
Bam! Out of there. Next!

I'm going a different road.

##Goal
This is my bucket list of things I want to accomplish before I can think about dating again.  
It's a real life RPG, using `rShiny` to track my progress.  
I am determined to become a more _disciplined_, _creative_, and _community-oriented_ person.  
Whether or not I hit all my goals, I hope the process will reinforce better life habits  
that will aid in my professional and personal development in my mid-twenties.
